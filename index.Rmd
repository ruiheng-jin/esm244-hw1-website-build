I’m a Master's student at the Bren School, specializing in Corporate Environmental Management and Energy & Climate. Through my curriculum here, I will gain skills in LCA, cost benefit analysis, environmental strategy planning, etc. With these skills, I wish to eventually work in corporate sustainability management, either in a corporate or NGO setting.

I owe my career choice to my hometown, Beijing. I grew up under a gray sky that was the growing pain of a developing country. During the 2008 Olympics—when coal power plants were closed, and traffics cut by half—I saw a blue sky, and potential for a cleaner future. That memory instilled in my 12-year-old mind a desire to make a difference.

I’m passionate about:
• Renewable energy
• Corporate sustainability
• Environmental issues and opportunities in China
• LEED green building
